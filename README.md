#### 📚 **About the Data**  
The dataset comprises customer data from a credit scoring system, including demographics, financial indicators, and credit behavior metrics. Key features analyzed include income, credit utilization, payment behavior, and credit history age.  

**Data Cleaning and Transformation:**  
The dataset required extensive cleaning due to:  
- **Invalid Entries**: Incorrect ages, garbage values, and missing fields.  
- **Missing Data**: Filled using group-wise modes or medians.  
- **Outliers**: Addressed through statistical methods like Median Absolute Deviation (MAD).  

**Sample Features:**  
- **Age**: Age of the customer in years.  
- **Annual Income**: Customer's yearly income in USD.  
- **Credit Mix**: Type of credit accounts (e.g., standard, good, bad).  
- **Num of Credit Cards**: Number of credit cards held.  
- **Monthly Inhand Salary**: Salary received after deductions.  
- **Outstanding Debt**: Total unpaid debt in USD.  
- **Credit Utilization Ratio**: Ratio of credit used to total available credit.  
- **Credit History Age**: Length of the credit history in years and months.

#### 🔍 **Key Business Insights and Recommendations**  

1. **Customer Segmentation**  
   - Identified distinct customer profiles based on income, credit behavior, and payment patterns.  
   - Established credit utilization thresholds for risk assessment.

2. **Predictive Scoring Models**  
   - Built credit risk scores integrating factors such as delayed payments, outstanding debt, and credit mix quality.  
   - Recommended segmentation to focus on high-risk customers with consistent late payments or high credit utilization.  

3. **Data-Driven Strategies for Risk Mitigation**  
   - **Targeted Credit Policies**: Introduced tailored loan products for low-risk customers with strong credit histories.  
   - **Enhanced Monitoring**: Suggested periodic analysis for customers exceeding recommended utilization limits.

#### 🔑 **Customer Profiles**  

- **Low Risk**:  
   - Credit Utilization Ratio below 30%.  
   - Credit history exceeding 3 years.  
   - Consistently on-time payments.  

- **Medium Risk**:  
   - Credit Utilization Ratio between 30% and 50%.  
   - Occasional delayed payments.  

- **High Risk**:  
   - Utilization Ratio above 50%.  
   - Significant outstanding debt.  
   - Frequent missed payments.
